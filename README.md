# VitalSync

> A cloud-native, distributed platform unifying **nutrition**, **workout**, and **health analytics** in a single application.

VitalSync lets users manage nutrition- and workout-related information and derive meaningful insights from the collected data. It is built as a distributed system of independent microservices following Domain-Driven Design, CQRS, and (where it adds business value) Event Sourcing.

> **Project status:** 🚧 Early development. Business requirements and domain models are intentionally refined iteratively. The technical architecture, however, is considered mandatory and stable. See [Architecture docs](./docs/architecture/overview.md).

## Vision

VitalSync combines three domains — **nutrition**, **fitness**, and **analytics** — behind a single, modern user experience. The platform is designed to be modular, extensible, maintainable, testable, loosely coupled, cloud-native, and reusable in the long term.

A core principle of the project: **the architecture is fixed, the domain is fluid.** Technical decisions (communication mechanisms, layer separation, architectural principles) are mandatory. Business requirements and domain models are expected to evolve as the project progresses.

## Business domains

### Nutrition
- Manage ingredients and their nutritional values
- Create recipes
- Compose meal plans
- Generate shopping lists
- Calculate nutrient intake based on consumed meals

### Fitness
- Manage exercises
- Create workout plans
- Track completed workout sessions
- Determine energy expenditure and calories burned

### Analytics & Reporting
- Reporting and analytical capabilities derived from nutrition and fitness data
- Specific analytics requirements are identified and extended throughout the project

> The final decomposition into Bounded Contexts is part of the project itself and is refined iteratively. See [Domain model](./docs/architecture/domain-model.md).

        Asynchronous messaging only

```

**Communication rules:**

- The Blazor frontend communicates **exclusively** through the BFF.
- The BFF exposes **REST** to the frontend and talks to microservices via **code-first gRPC**.
- Microservices **never** call each other synchronously. All inter-service communication is **asynchronous** via a messaging platform.

See [Communication](./docs/architecture/communication.md) for details.

## Technology stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Orchestration | .NET Aspire 13 |
| Frontend | Blazor |
| Backend-for-Frontend | REST (outbound) + code-first gRPC (to services) |
| Microservices | ASP.NET Core, one per business area |
| Inter-service messaging | Kafka *or* RabbitMQ *(decision pending — see ADR-0004)* |
| Persistence | Entity Framework Core; Event Sourcing where it adds business value |
| Patterns | DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing (selective) |
| Testing | xUnit, FluentAssertions, NSubstitute, EF Core InMemory |

> **Note:** `.NET Aspire 13` is the chosen orchestrator version for this project. Aspire is applied at the orchestration/application layer; the reusable Building Blocks remain framework-agnostic.

## Repository structure

```

## Building Blocks platform

In addition to the application, VitalSync includes a **reusable platform of shared Building Blocks** providing reusable concepts for the Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Persistence, Event Processing, and Common Utilities layers.

These Building Blocks are deliberately **independent of VitalSync** and reusable in future projects. See [Building Blocks](./docs/architecture/building-blocks.md).

## Getting started

> ⚠️ Prerequisites and run instructions will be expanded as the application code lands.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version aligned with .NET Aspire 13)
- [.NET Aspire 13 workload](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/)
- Docker (for local messaging infrastructure and containers)

### Build

```bash
dotnet build
```

### Run (Aspire AppHost)

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Aspire/VitalSync.AppHost
```

> The exact project paths will be confirmed once the Aspire AppHost is added.

## Testing

The testing strategy includes (but is not limited to): unit, integration, domain, application-layer, persistence, and component-communication tests.

```bash
dotnet test
```

See [Testing strategy](./docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md).
